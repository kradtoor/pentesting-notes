    sudo nvim /etc/hosts

    :/0.0.0.0                          #<enter>
    ```
    
    3. Press the following combination _(this should be select all the occurrences)_
    ```shell
    ggVG
    ```
    
    4. And immediately type the pattern to search and replace
    ```shell
    :s/0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1/gc            #<enter>
    ```
    
    5. The prompt will show you something like this:
