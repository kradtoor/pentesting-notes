# Neovim Themes

## Plugin your theme

First open vim plug and add your theme, you can add as many themes as you want here to switch between them at any time

I'm going to be installing the onedark theme I'll link to a repo with a bunch of others at the bottom of the blog

Open `vim-plug/plugins.vim` and add the following:

```
Plug 'sonph/onehalf', { 'rtp': 'vim' }
```

Make sure to run `:PlugInstall`
